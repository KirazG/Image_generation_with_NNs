Generating new images of one of my favorite things to look at (and eat)... Cake! 

Cake images are scraped from ImageNet URLs and a few additional web sources. A convolutional variational autoencoder is built with code adapted from the Keras blog and trained with cake images dataset. Many epochs later, results are **slightly** blurry, but tasty!
